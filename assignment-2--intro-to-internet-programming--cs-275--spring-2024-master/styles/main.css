/* * Your CSS must validate using the enclosed `.stylelintrc.json` file.
* Your JavaScript must validate using the included `.eslintrc.json` file.
* Your JavaScript must be transpiled to ES5.
* Saving a file of type `.css`  or `.js` must lint/validate the respective language file. Recall that you needn’t validate HTML, because you’re not allowed to edit it, and it’s already been linted.
* Saving any of the aforementioned source files should also refresh the browser, after linting.
* The entire development track must be triggered by typing `gulp`. */
